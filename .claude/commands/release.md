## Context

- Current versions:
  !`node -e "const p=require('./package.json');const m=require('./manifest.json');console.log('package.json: '+p.version+'\nmanifest.json: '+m.version)"`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status --short`
- Commits since last release:
  !`git log $(git log --format="%H %s" | grep -m1 "chore: bump version" | awk '{print $1}')..HEAD --oneline --no-merges`

## Your task

The user wants to publish a new release. The bump type is provided as an
argument: `patch`, `minor`, or `major`. If no argument was given, ask the user
which bump type they want.

### 1. Calculate new version

Given the current version from `package.json`, compute the new version by
bumping the appropriate segment:

- `patch` — increment the third number (e.g. 0.1.1 → 0.1.2)
- `minor` — increment the second number, reset patch to 0 (e.g. 0.1.1 → 0.2.0)
- `major` — increment the first number, reset minor and patch to 0 (e.g. 0.1.1 →
  1.0.0)

### 2. Summarise changes

Using the commits listed in the context above, categorise them into changelog
sections. Map conventional commit prefixes as follows:

- `feat:` → **Added**
- `fix:` → **Fixed**
- `docs:` → **Changed**
- `refactor:` / `perf:` → **Changed**
- `chore:` / `test:` / `ci:` → omit (internal, not user-facing)

Strip the prefix and capitalise the first letter of each entry. Omit merge
commits and version bump commits.

### 3. Confirm with the user

Before making any changes, present a summary and ask for confirmation:

```
Ready to release:
  Bump type : <patch|minor|major>
  Version   : <current> → <new>
  Files     : package.json, manifest.json, CHANGELOG.md
  Actions   : update CHANGELOG.md → commit → push to main → push to release branch

Changes in this release:
  Added
  - <entry>

  Fixed
  - <entry>

  Changed
  - <entry>

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

Only show sections that have entries. Only continue if the user confirms.

### 4. Check for uncommitted changes

If `git status` shows uncommitted changes, warn the user and ask whether to
proceed anyway or abort.

### 5. Update CHANGELOG.md

Read `CHANGELOG.md`. Insert a new version section immediately after the
`## [Unreleased]` heading (keep the Unreleased section, but empty its content).
The new section format is:

```markdown
## [<new-version>] - <YYYY-MM-DD>

### Added

- <entry>

### Fixed

- <entry>

### Changed

- <entry>
```

Only include sections that have entries. Use today's date for the release date.

### 6. Update version files

Using the Edit tool, update the `"version"` field in both:

- `package.json`
- `manifest.json`

Both must be set to exactly the same new version string.

### 7. Commit and push

```bash
git add package.json manifest.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: bump version to <new>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>"
git push
git push origin main:release
```

### 8. Confirm completion

Report the new version and confirm that the release CI has been triggered on the
`release` branch.

## Important

- Never skip the user confirmation step
- Ensure `package.json` and `manifest.json` versions are always identical
- Do not push if the commit fails
- Do not bump the version if the working tree has uncommitted changes unless the
  user explicitly approves
